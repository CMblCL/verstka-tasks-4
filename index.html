                    the ash barrel. Cole&shy;man said he must have it and promised to pay $1.50.
                    He didn't come back for it at the time he agreed so, af&shy;ter a long
                    pe&shy;riod an actor came in and said he wanted an old
                    plug hat. we offered him Cole&shy;man's at $1.50. He kicked hard at paying that
                    price, but as he had to have one he finaliy gave in and we came out even.
                    Then Cole&shy;man turned up and de&shy;manded his hat.</q>

                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Gen. E. Frankel, my grandmoth&shy;er's cousin, has just died at Breslau.</q>
                    said he yes&shy;ter&shy;day. <q>leav&shy;ing his fortune of 40.000.000 marks,
                    or $8.000.000 to the hos&shy;pitals there. It is my in&shy;tention to fight the
                    will as I consid&shy;er it most unjust that my grandmoth&shy;er, moth&shy;er,
                    my&shy;self and broth&shy;er should be overlookol in the dis&shy;tri&shy;bution
                    of the estate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My grandmoth&shy;er, Babette Frankel, is still alive. She is 85 years old, and,
                    Gen. Frankel was her cousin. He was n Aus&shy;trian, but he stayed in Breslau
                    af&shy;ter it was cap&shy;tured by the Germans. He was born there, he lived
                    there all his life, he fought against German occap&shy;ation, and he died there,
                    and in dying he left ev&shy;ery&shy;thing to the city, which is most unfair tơ
                    us, his four helrs. The sole rel&shy;atives are my grandmoth&shy;er,
                    moth&shy;er, broth&shy;er and my&shy;self, and we should share in
                    the estate with Breslau.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>The estate consists of land, houses and mon&shy;ey. Gen. Frankel loaned large
                    surns to the city of Breslau and he left a huge sum in cash. The mon&shy;ey
                    lent to the city and expended princirally in building hos&shy;pitals and I
                    suppose he felt it would be a nice thing to wipe out the debt by his legacy.
                    But he forgot his rel&shy;atives and we have re&shy;solved to con&shy;test
                    the will.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Do you think Gen. Frankel desinher&shy;ited you because of any squabble?<q/>
                    he was asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>My moth&shy;er's fam&shy;ily had no quarrel with him.</q> was the reply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Balla came to the United States two years ago from Vi&shy;enna, where his
                    moth&shy;er and broth&shy;er re&shy;side. He lived in San Francisco for a
                    few months, but at the time of the earth&shy;quake and fire became to
                    Los An&shy;ge&shy;les.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>If I get my share of this fortune I shal rema in this beautiful South&shy;ern
                    California.</q> he remarked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ti&shy;tles which he holds where confarred on him by the late King
                    Car&shy;los of Portu&shy;gal. <q>My fam&shy;ily reptered politacal ser&shy;vices
